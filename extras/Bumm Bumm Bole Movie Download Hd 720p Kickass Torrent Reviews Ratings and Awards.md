Bumm Bumm Bole is not just a film about shoes, but also about the innocence and resilience of children who face hardships and challenges in their lives. The film showcases the brilliant performances of Darsheel Safary and Ziyah Vastani, who play the brother and sister duo with utmost sincerity and charm. They make you laugh, cry and root for them as they try to overcome their problems with courage and optimism. The film also features Atul Kulkarni and Rituparna Sengupta as their parents, who portray their roles with subtlety and grace.
 
The film is directed by Priyadarshan, who is known for his comedies, but also has a flair for making sensitive and meaningful films. He adapts the Iranian classic Children of Heaven with his own vision and style, adding some elements of drama, humour and thrill to the original story. However, he also deviates from the main plot by introducing some unnecessary sub-plots that dilute the impact of the film. For instance, the film tries to depict the terror-infested scenario of Assam, where bomb blasts, encounters and rapes are common. But these scenes do not gel well with the tone and theme of the film, which is essentially a children's film. Moreover, the film drags on for too long, especially in the second half, where the marathon race becomes tedious and boring.
 
Bumm Bumm Bole is a film that has its heart in the right place, but fails to deliver a satisfying cinematic experience. It could have been a much better film if it had focused more on the simple and touching story of the two siblings and their shoes. The film has some moments that will touch your soul, but they are few and far between. The film is not a complete waste of time, but it is not a must-watch either.
